# AnonymousMicrosoftWebData

The purpose of this project is to give some hands-on experience with spark and its hadoop api. The purpose is to be able to analyze the set of Anonymous Microsoft Web Data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anonymous+Microsoft+Web+Data) and for this reason it was required to be able to split data in a way that lines starting with C and all the following ones starting with V, are in the same block / key in hard disk.
